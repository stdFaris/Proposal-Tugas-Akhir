	abstract = {Image Transformer has recently achieved significant progress for natural image understanding, either using supervised (ViT, DeiT, etc.) or self-supervised (BEiT, MAE, etc.) pre-training techniques. In this paper, we propose DiT, a self-supervised pre-trained Document Image Transformer model using large-scale unlabeled text images for Document AI tasks, which is essential since no supervised counterparts ever exist due to the lack of human-labeled document images. We leverage DiT as the backbone network in a variety of vision-based Document AI tasks, including document image classification, document layout analysis, table detection as well as text detection for OCR. Experiment results have illustrated that the self-supervised pre-trained DiT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on these downstream tasks, e.g. document image classification (91.11 - 92.69), document layout analysis (91.0 - 94.9), table detection (94.23 - 96.55) and text detection for OCR (93.07 - 94.29). The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://aka.ms/msdit.},

	abstract = {Pre-training techniques have been verified successfully in a variety of NLP tasks in recent years. Despite the widespread use of pre-training models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation, while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding. In this paper, we propose the LayoutLM to jointly model interactions between text and layout information across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from scanned documents. Furthermore, we also leverage image features to incorporate words' visual information into LayoutLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework for document-level pre-training. It achieves new state-of-the-art results in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.72 to 79.27), receipt understanding (from 94.02 to 95.24) and document image classification (from 93.07 to 94.42).

	abstract = {Through digital transformation, lots of personal data are captured, but individuals often do not have ownership or control over them. This results in the emerging Web 3.0, where people demand data sovereignty. There are actually two conceptually related terms, data sovereignty and digital sovereignty. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their points of focus, guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and then analyses the requirements and technical challenges of their implementation. To understand the emerging trend shift in digital sovereignty towards individuals taking control of security and privacy preserving over their own digital assets, this paper conducts a systematic review and analysis on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is a user-centric decentralized model and autonomy for an individual to self-determine the access and use of one's identity and credentials. The review covers existing SSI solutions and points out that an efficient key management system, the scalability and interoperability of the solution, and a well-established standard are some of the challenges for SSI deployment. Finally, the paper concludes with open issues about digital identity, including dynamic attributes, persona, and attribute ownership, that challenge the current reference architecture of SSI as well as its implementation.},

	abstract = {Document layout analysis (DLA) is a preprocessing step of document understanding systems. It is responsible for detecting and annotating the physical structure of documents. DLA has several important applications such as document retrieval, content categorization, text recognition, and the like. The objective of DLA is to ease the subsequent analysis/recognition phases by identifying the document-homogeneous blocks and by determining their relationships. The DLA pipeline consists of several phases that could vary among DLA methods, depending on the documents’ layouts and final analysis objectives. In this regard, a universal DLA algorithm that fits all types of document-layouts or that satisfies all analysis objectives has not been developed, yet. In this survey paper, we present a critical study of different document layout analysis techniques. The study highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing DLA and discusses comprehensively the different phases of the DLA algorithms based on a general framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing the research in the field. The DLA framework consists of preprocessing, layout analysis strategies, post-processing, and performance evaluation phases. Overall, the article delivers an essential baseline for pursuing further research in document layout analysis.},
